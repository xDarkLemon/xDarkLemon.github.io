# About

Though I am a lovely little kitten, I do serious research. My research interests include theory and application in natural cat language processing, and my current focus is large-scale pre-trained language model. My goal is to enable reliable communication in natural cat langauge between machines, cats and humans. 

In my spare time, I love studying math, instead of computer science. Recently I want to learn algebra and topology.
