  **gdriveget: Automatic Downloading Google Drive Files Tool**

Typically, you can download a google drive file by the wget command. However, for large files and binary files this does not work, because it pops up a "Can't scan file for viruses" window. This tool helps you get the real download link from the virus warning html page, which contains a code generated by the cookie, and downloads the files with the real link for you.
